    "# Homework 10: Cleaning data with Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to use regular expressions!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hints and notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening files in subdirectories\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this notebook might be **homework/**, but!!! the csvs and text files might be in **homework/scraped/** or **/homework/scraped/minutes_pdfs** or **/homework/pdfs/**. To open a file in a subdirectory, instead of having the filename be `\"file.csv\"` you'll just use `\"some/subfolder/file.csv\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening text files\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open up a file, read it in and show you the first 500 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "contents = open(\"your-filename.txt\").read()\n",
    "contents[0:500]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> You might need `open(\"your-filename.txt\", encoding=\"utf8\").read()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using regex\n",
    "\n",
    "For some dumb reason you need to put `r` in front of the string you use when you're talking about regex. Just plain `\"(\\d\\d\\d)\"` will usually work, but *sometimes* it won't and you'll need `r\"(\\d\\d\\d)`. It's best to just use the `r` all of the time, if you can remember!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `.str.extract`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use `.str.extract`, you're always going to **capture one thing** and save it to a new column. You need to wrap the things you're interested in with parenthesis `(` `)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['phone_number'] = df['old_column'].str.extract(r\"My phone number is (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting pandas options\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has a lot of options, like how many columns or rows it will show you, or how many characters it will show in a column before it stops showing you anything. Here are a few useful ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `display.max_cols`: Number of columns to show at once\n",
    "* `display.max_rows`: Number of rows to show at once\n",
    "* `display.max_colwidth`: Maximum number of characters displayed from a string\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set them using `pd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 1000)`, for example, to show 1000 rows at a time. You can find a lot more at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.set_option.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular expressions reference\n",
    "\n",
    "I personally think http://www.regular-expressions.info/ is a wonderful wonderful reference (and tutorial), even if it's ugly! But here's a quick reference for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\d` is a digit\n",
    "* `\\d*` is zero or more digits \n",
    "* `\\d+` is one or more digits\n",
    "* `.` matches anything for ONE character\n",
    "* `.*` is \"give me anything forever\"\n",
    "* `\\s` is whitespace, a.k.a. spaces and tabs\n",
    "* `\\w` is a word character, which includes capital and lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens.\n",
    "* You can put `*` after anything, so `\\w*` would mean \"as many word characters as you can find\"\n",
    "* `\\b` is a word boundary (you'll need the `r\"\"` thing for this one)\n",
    "* `( )` is a \"capture group\" for saving something\n",
    "* `\\1` is used when doing find/replace to say \"put the first captured group here\" (note, it's a dollar sign instead of a backslash in some editors)\n",
    "* `[ABCDE]` is a character class, which means \"match one of these, I don't care which\"\n",
    "* dollar sign means \"end of the line\"\n",
    "* caret ^ means \"beginning of the line\"\n",
    "* `\\.` means \"no really seriously I mean a period not just anything\"\n",
    "* You can use `\\` with anything else that would normally be a special character, too, not just periods. `(` or `[` or whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning up extracted columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you get `\\n` (newlines) or spaces or `\\t` (tabs) or stuff at the beginning or the end of your column. `.str.strip()` will usually take care of that, just attach it after your `.str.extract()`\n",
    "\n",
    "After you extract something, it's still a string even though you look at it and know it's a number. Use `.astype(int)` to turn it into an integer (no decimal) or `.astype(float)` to turn it into a float (yes decimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing regular expressions in general\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if I'm using regex in pandas or Python, I like to test them in my text editor with \"Find.\" The highlighting really helps me see if I'm matching things! I also like to think \"what stays the same?\" when designing patterns, write those parts first, then fill in the blanks with what I want to capture."

    "\n",
    "1. `price_original`, the original price, one of the new price\n",

    "**Tip:** Remember that `$` is a special regex symbol! You might need to escape it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** When doing `.str.extract`, the whole match doesn't get captured, only what you put `()` around! Think about anchoring to different points of the string, or things in the string.\n",

    "Once upon a time my student Stefan did a project that involved some lawyer stuff. Most of the content was in PDFs, though! I converted them to text files and put them into the `pdfs` folder, and gave you code below to open up each of them and save their contents into a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a nice dataframe! I want you to add the following columns to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `lawyer_app`, the applicant's lawyer (pro se means that they did it themselves, that's fine)\n",
    "* `lawyer_gov`, the government's lawyer\n",
    "* `judge`, the name of the judge\n",
    "* `access`, whether the clearance is granted or denied (although you might miss a few)\n",
    "\n",
    "Save as **court_cleaned.csv**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You can look at the original PDFs, they're also included.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This uses a fun utility called `glob`, which is mostly fun because you use it as `glob.glob`. It's used to find files that match a certain filename pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BONUS:** You'll be happy once you get the judge, but make sure it doesn't have any extra punctuation on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BONUS:** You can for some words using `.str.contains(\"blah\")` and save it into new columns. Maybe `has_debt`, `has_bankruptcy`, etc.\n",

He  was  also  advised  of  the  serious \\nsecurity concerns raised by his possession of a current foreign passport and that such \\nconcerns may be mitigated by surrendering or relinquishing the passport as set forth in \\nthe Directive.4 Applicant did not submit a response or provide additional documentation. \\nThe record closed on December 15, 2015. \\n \\n\\nOn  August  31,  2015,  Applicant  acknowledged  receipt  of  the  FORM.3  He  was \\n\\nAdministrative Notice: The Russian Federation (Russia) \\n\\nDOHA  administrative \\n\\njudges  may  accept \\n\\n \\n \\nfor  administrative  notice \\nuncontroverted,  easily  verifiable  facts  regarding  a  foreign  country  from  official  U.S. \\nGovernment reports. Additionally, the official position of relevant federal agencies or the \\npertinent statements of key U.S. Government officials regarding a foreign country may \\nbe appropriate for administrative notice.

He received a commission \\nas an officer in Russia’s reserve military forces and worked for a time for the Russian \\nDefense Ministry. He immigrated to the United States in 1997 and married his wife, who \\nis also originally from Russia, in 2002. They have one child, who was born in the United \\nStates.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2005.  Applicant,  his  wife,  and  his  child  all \\nhave  dual  U.S.-Russian  citizenships.  Since  becoming  a  U.S.  citizen,  Applicant  has \\n                                                           \\n5  Department  Counsel’s  “failure”  to  submit  the  source  documents  is  understandable  as  the  FORM \\npredates  the  cited  Appeal  Board  decision.  Arguably,  Ex.  5  could  be  admitted  as  a  summary  of  the \\npertinent  facts  contained  in  the  source  documents.

However, based on the present record, I cannot find that Applicant’s failure to raise an objection to \\nEx. 5 amounts to an agreement as to the exhibits accuracy, reliability, and relevancy. Contrast with, ISCR \\nCase No. 14-03112 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2015), after applicant concurred with its content, the only evidence \\nregarding the foreign country was the administrative notice request that was admitted as a summary. \\n \\n6 Applicant was provided notice regarding these source documents with the FORM. He was also provided \\nample opportunity to challenge or provide additional information regarding the matters requested by the \\nGovernment for administrative notice. Although the Government’s citation to 26 source documents raises \\npotential notice and fairness concerns, the additional time Applicant was provided to respond and provide \\nadditional information ameliorated any such concerns.  \\n \\n7  Director  of  National  Intelligence,  Statement  for  the  Record,  Senate  Armed  Services  Committee, \\nWorldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community at 4, February 26, 2015.  \\n \\n8 U.S. State Department, Russia 2013 Human Rights Report at 1.  \\n \\n9 Id. at 1-2.  \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",

E.O. 10865 § 2. \\n\\n \\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  eligibility \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance,  an \\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \\nintroductory  explanations,  the  guidelines  list  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating \\nconditions.  The  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  an  administrative  judge  applies  the  guidelines  in  a  \\ncommonsense manner, considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a \\nfair and impartial decision.  \\n\\n \\nDepartment  Counsel  must  present  evidence  to  establish  controverted  facts \\nalleged  in  the  SOR.

       "“security  clearance  determinations  should  err,  if  they  must,  on  the  side  of  denials.” \\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \\ntrust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it  grants  access  to  classified  information. \\nDecisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the  possible  risk  an  applicant  may \\ndeliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions \\nentail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than \\nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \\n \\n\\nClearance  decisions  must  be  made  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall \\nin  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the  applicant  concerned.”  E.O. \\n10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance amounts to a finding that an \\napplicant,  at  the  time  the  decision  was  rendered,  did  not  meet  the  strict  guidelines \\nestablished for determining eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference  \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG  ¶  9,  the  foreign  preference  security  concern  arises  “[w]hen  an \\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \\nUnited States.” Applicant actively exercised his foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. \\ncitizen,  including  voting  in  Russian  elections  and  renewing,  using,  and  maintaining  a \\nRussian passport. This record evidence raises the foreign preference security concern \\nand  establishes  the  disqualifying  condition  at  AG  ¶  10(a).10  The  foreign  preference \\nguideline also sets forth a number of potential mitigation conditions. I have considered \\nall the mitigating conditions and none apply. Notably, Applicant currently has a foreign \\npassport and is unwilling to relinquish or surrender it. A current or prospective clearance \\nholder  is  ineligible  for  a  security  clearance  unless  s/he  surrenders  it  to  the  cognizant \\nsecurity authority (CSA), invalidates the foreign passport, or receives approval from the \\nCSA for his/her continued possession and use of the foreign passport. See AG ¶¶ 11(d) \\nand  11(e).  Applicant  did  not  supply  any  information  that  any  of  the  preceding \\ncircumstances apply. Accordingly, foreign preference security concerns remain.  \\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe foreign influence security concern is explained at AG ¶ 6:  \\n \\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\n\\n                                                           \\n10 Exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . .

AG ¶ 2(b). \\n \\n \\nI  have  considered  all  the foreign  influence mitigating  conditions and,  based  on \\nthe  record  evidence,  none  apply.  Even  if  I  assume  for  the  sake  of  argument  that \\nApplicant’s property and non-familial connections in Russia are not significant enough to \\ncause  a  conflict  of  interest  with  his  security  obligations,  his  and  his  wife’s  close \\nrelationship to their family members in Russia raise a concern about his vulnerability or \\nsusceptibility to adverse foreign influence.

Applicant’s  familial  connections  in  Russia, \\ncoupled with the threat posed by the current Russian government to its own people and \\nthe security threat it poses to the United States, raises a heightened risk that Applicant \\ncould  be  subjected  to  adverse  foreign  influence.  Applicant  did  not  present  sufficient \\ninformation  to  mitigate  this  security  concern.  However,  this  adverse  finding  is  “not  a \\ncomment on Applicant’s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act \\nin unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, \\nsuch as a family member.” ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd.

       "The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\\nAugust 19, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\\ndecision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\\non the written record.  On June 27, 2016, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant’s request for a\\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\\n\\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in making findings\\nof fact and whether the Judge’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\\nwith the following, we affirm.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Findings of Fact  \\n\\nApplicant is 46 years old, married, and has four children.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in\\n1994.    Since  2010,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.    In  his  security  clearance\\napplication, he explained that he encountered difficultly paying bills in 2008 after being laid off\\nfrom a second job due to the company’s bankruptcy.  He gave no explanation for why he did not\\nbegin attempting to resolve the debts until the issuance of the SOR.\\n\\nApplicant admitted each of the five delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.  For the debt in\\nSOR  ¶  1.a  for  about  $500,  Applicant  wrote  in  his  Response  to  Department  Counsel’s  File  of\\nRelevant Material (FORM) that the debt was paid off.  The creditor agreed to accept three monthly\\npayments of about $100 to settle the debt.  A document showed the creditor made arrangements with\\nApplicant to debit electronically about $100 from his account in September 2015 for this debt.  For\\nthe 2009 judgment in SOR ¶ 1.b for about $14,000, Applicant indicated that, at the time he answered\\nthe SOR, he was unable to negotiate a settlement.  In his Response to the FORM, he provided\\ndocuments showing his wages were being garnished biweekly for the next six months for this debt\\nand about $350 was garnished from his pay at the end of November 2015.  No evidence was\\npresented to establish the total amount deducted from his pay or how much is still owed on that debt. \\nFor the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.b, and 1.c for about $2,500, $5,600, and $3600, Applicant wrote in\\nhis Response to the FORM that he is currently on a schedule to repay between $150 and $190 a\\nmonth on each debt until it is resolved.  He provided proof of payments toward those debts from\\nSeptember through November 2015.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Analysis\\n\\nThe  Judge  found  Applicant  did  not  act  responsibly  because,  even  though  he  has  been\\nemployed by his current employer since 2010, he only began making payments towards the debts\\nafter the SOR was issued.  The Judge also concluded that, while the mitigation condition concerning\\nthe initiation of a good-faith effort to repay the creditors was applicable, it was not controlling\\nbecause Applicant must establish a consistent history of continuing to resolve his debts. \\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n2\\n\\n\f",
       "In the appeal brief, Applicant provided character reference letters and documents showing\\npayments  on,  or  settlement  of,  various  debts.    Most  of  those  documents,  however,  were  not\\npreviously submitted to the Judge and constitute new evidence that the Appeal Board is prohibited\\nfrom receiving or considering.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  \\n\\nApplicant claims the Judge erred in the findings of fact.  For example, he states that he has\\nsix children (instead of four) and started working for his current employer in 2012 (instead of 2010). \\nIn  his  security  clearance  application,  however,  Applicant  listed  that  he  had  four  children  and\\nindicated he started working for his employer in 2010.  He failed to establish that the Judge erred\\nin the findings of fact.  Our review reveals the Judge’s material findings are based upon substantial\\nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the record\\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. July 25, 2014).  Applicant also argues\\nthat he mitigated the security concerns arising from his debts.  His arguments are not sufficient to\\nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\\nlaw.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06634 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 28, 2016).   \\n   \\n\\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may\\nbe granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’” Department\\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt\\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\\nof the national security.”\\n\\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \\n\\nOrder\\n\\nSigned: Michael Ra’anan        \\nMichael Ra’anan\\nAdministrative Judge\\nChairperson, Appeal Board\\n\\nSigned: James E.

Eligibility  for \\n\\naccess to classified information is granted.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\nOn October 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \\nReasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under  Guideline  F,  financial \\nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \\n1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  implemented  by \\nthe DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  responded  to  the  SOR  on  November  14,  2014,  and  requested  a \\nhearing  before  an  administrative  judge.  The  case  was  originally  assigned  to  me  on \\nFebruary 27, 2015. Scheduling of the case was delayed because Applicant was working \\noverseas. The case was reassigned to me on May 4, 2015. After coordinating with the \\nparties, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\f",
       "on  July  16,  2015,  scheduling  the  hearing  for  August  18,  2015.  The  hearing  was \\nconvened  as  scheduled.  DOHA  received  the  hearing  transcript  (Tr.)  on  August  26, \\n2015.  \\n \\n\\nEvidentiary Rulings \\n\\nGovernment  Exhibits  (GE)  1,  2,  4,  5,  and  6  were  admitted  in  evidence  without \\nobjection. GE 3 was admitted over Applicant’s objection. Applicant testified, called five \\nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through Z, which were admitted \\nwithout  objection.  The  record  was  held  open  for  Applicant  to  submit  additional \\ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked AE AA and BB1 and admitted \\nwithout objection.  \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 57-year-old self-employed contractor for a defense contractor. He \\nserved  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1979  until  he  retired  in  2000.  He  seeks  to  retain  a \\nsecurity clearance, which he has held since he was in the military. He attended college \\nfor a period, but he is a few credits shy of a degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. \\nHe has been married to his current spouse for more than 25 years. He has two adult \\nchildren.2 \\n \\n \\nApplicant spent the majority of his military career in special operations. He went \\non  numerous  combat  missions,  conducted  clandestine  insertions,  and  operated \\nundercover.  When  he  retired  he  became  an  entrepreneur  and  started  his  own \\ncompanies.  His  primary  company  was  incorporated,  but  Applicant  had  to  personally \\nguarantee many of the company’s liabilities. He also invested in real estate. His primary \\ncompany  suffered  significant  setbacks  during  the  recession  and  housing  crisis  of  the \\nlater part of the 2000s. His real estate properties lost much of their value. He closed his \\nprimary  company  in  2009  and  has  been  working  since  then  as  a  self-employed \\ncontractor and subcontractor for other companies. He has spent much of the last five \\nyears working overseas in dangerous assignments.3 \\n \\n  \\nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, which include a $58,161 judgment (SOR \\n¶  1.a),  mortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶  1.c  -  $30,994;  SOR  ¶  1.d  -  $351,562;  SOR  ¶  1.e  - \\n$271,900; and SOR ¶ 1.f - $50,688), two business-related debts (SOR ¶ 1.b - $18,028 \\nand SOR ¶ 1.h - $77,115) and federal taxes (SOR ¶ 1.g - $33,882 for tax year 2008, \\nand SOR ¶ 1.i – no amount alleged for tax years 2012 and 2013). Applicant admitted \\nowing most of the debts at some point, but several of the debts were paid, settled, or \\notherwise resolved. \\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n1  Counsel  marked  the  post-hearing  submissions  as  Z  and  AA,  but  AE  Z  was  already  admitted  at  the \\nhearing.  \\n \\n2 Tr. at 118, 123-127, 184; GE 1, 3 AE A. \\n \\n3 Tr. at 28-31, 120, 127-131; GE 1, 3; AE A, T. \\n\\n \\n2 \\n\\n\f",
       " \\nApplicant’s primary company was growing, and it leased a larger warehouse in \\nabout  2008.  The  business  ultimately  failed,  and  the  company  broke  the  lease.  The \\nowner of the warehouse sued  Applicant  personally  and  obtained a $58,161 judgment \\nagainst  him  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  on  this \\njudgment.4  \\n \\n \\nApplicant and a partner had a falling out over the business. The ex-partner sued \\nApplicant  for  $160,000.  They  reached  a  settlement  through  arbitration  in  which \\nApplicant agreed to pay the ex-partner $163,000 by 2010. He paid about $86,000, but \\nhe  was  unable  to  pay  the  remainder  when  the  company  closed.  The  partner  either \\nobtained  a  judgment  for  $77,000  or  sought  to  enforce  the  arbitrated  settlement. \\nApplicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  for  the  remainder  owed  to  the  ex-\\npartner.5 \\n \\nIn February 2013, Applicant settled the $20,302 business credit card debt alleged \\n \\nin  SOR  ¶  1.b  (alleged  as  $18,028  in  SOR)  for  $10,151,  which  was  paid  in  February \\n2013. Applicant submitted proof in his response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2014 \\nthat the debt had been settled. The February 2014 credit report lists the account with a \\nzero balance, with the annotation that it was transferred, sold, and paid.6 \\n \\n \\nApplicant was due a refund from his 2007 federal income taxes, but he owed the \\nIRS for tax year 2008. The IRS filed a $33,882 tax lien against Applicant in June 2010 \\n(SOR ¶ 1.g). In January 2011, the IRS applied his $15,892 refund from his 2007 taxes \\nto his 2008 taxes. Applicant paid the remaining $5,689 owed for 2008 in January 2013. \\nThe  2014  credit  reports  obtained  by  the  Government  report  the  lien  as  released  in \\nJanuary 2013.7 \\n \\n \\nApplicant owed the IRS $65,863 for his 2012 and 2013 federal income taxes. In \\nApril  2015,  he  submitted  a  proposed  installment  agreement  to  the  IRS  whereby  he \\nwould  pay  an  initial  $915  and  then  $500  per  month  until  paid.  In  July  2015,  the  IRS \\naccepted  Applicant’s  installment  agreement  and  added  his  2014  taxes.  On  June  5, \\n2015,  Applicant  paid  the  IRS  $56,415  for  his  2014  taxes.  On  July  9,  2015,  he  paid \\n$10,000 toward his estimated taxes for 2015.8 \\n \\n \\nApplicant used to own five properties consisting of his residence and four rental \\nproperties. Some of his tenants did not pay their rent, and he also had a property vacant \\nfor an extended period. Applicant bought his home and another property when he was \\nin the military. He still has those properties, plus another, but he lost two properties to \\nforeclosure.

He settled the debt for $7,517, which he paid in August 2015. Applicant is current \\non  the  first  mortgage  loan  on  his  residence  and  the  mortgage  loans  on  his  two \\nremaining investment properties.12 \\n \\n \\nApplicant paid other debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He repaid a $10,000 \\nloan from his former commanding officer. He borrowed $50,000 from a friend who he \\nserved with in the military in an effort to maintain his business.

He credibly testified that it will \\ntake time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts.14  \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s character evidence was extraordinary. He submitted numerous letters \\nand  several  witnesses  testified.  Many  of  the  authors  and  witnesses  served  with \\nApplicant in special operations. His former commanding officer testified that he served \\nwith  Applicant  under  conditions  that  the  commanding  officer  modesty  described  as \\n“quite  stressful.”  The  endorsements  of  the  witnessses  and  authors  were  unequivocal \\nand exceptional.15 \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.

The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \\n\\n \\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \\n\\n \\n\\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \\n \\n  \\nprovided under AG ¶ 20.

Additionally, the SOR alleged the high credit on the two \\nmortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  -  $351,562  and  1.e  -  $271,900),  when  the  balances  on \\nthose loans were reported as zero.  \\n \\n  \\nApplicant paid his 2008 federal income taxes. He has a payment plan in place for \\nhis  2012  and  2013  tax  years.  He  settled  and  paid  the  second  mortgage  loan  on  his \\nhome,  and  he  paid  other  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  His  attorney  is \\nnegotiating  settlements  for  the  two  judgments  against  him.  Applicant  credibly  testified \\nthat it will take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts. \\n \\n \\nI find that Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he \\ntook significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly and made a good-\\nfaith effort to pay his debts. There are clear indications that his financial problems are \\nbeing  resolved  and  are  under  control.  They  occurred  under  circumstances  that  are \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  do  not  cast  doubt  on  his  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and \\ngood judgment.

Applicant had no \\nobjection to the amendment. The motion to amend was granted.2 \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 40-year-old mechanic who works as a quality assurance inspector \\nfor  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been  working  for  that  contractor  in  the  Middle  East \\nsince May 2011 and has worked overseas for other defense contractors for a number of \\nyears.  He  earned  a  general  educational  development  certificate  in  1996  and  an \\nassociate’s degree in 2003. He has been married twice. He married his current wife in \\n2005. He has three children, ages 15, 16, and 22.3 \\n \\n\\nExcluding  the  withdrawn  allegations,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  three \\ndelinquent  debts  totaling  $64,168  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c).  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he \\ndenied each debt. Substantial evidence of the alleged debts is contained in GE 1-4.4  \\n\\n \\nIn 1999, Applicant was involved in a car accident and incurred a broken pelvis \\nand hip. He was determined to be fully disabled and collected about $1,000 per month \\nin disability payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA). While receiving the \\ndisability benefits, he knew there was a limit on how much income he could earn, but \\ndid not know the exact restrictions. In 2006, he received a letter from SSA that indicated \\n                                                           \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1 Tr. 23-25.  \\n\\n2 Tr. 43-44.  \\n\\n3 Tr. 5-7, 23, 37-39, 42-43; GE 1. \\n\\n4 GE 1-4; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.  \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "he was earning more income than he was allowed. At that time, his disability payments \\nstopped, and he has not received any further disability payments since then.5 \\n\\n \\nA credit report dated June 12, 2010, reflected that Applicant’s SSA account had \\nbeen  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $20,955  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  This  delinquent \\naccount was the result of his overpayment of disability payments. In 2008, he started \\nrepaying this debt through a monthly pay allotment of $300. When he left his job later \\nthat year, the allotment stopped. In 2012, the SSA began garnishing his pay at a rate of \\n$600 every two weeks. By early 2014 (well before the issuance of the SOR), he fully \\nrepaid this debt. In July 2014, he received a letter from the SSA stating he overpaid the \\ndebt and would be receiving a refund of $2,535.6 \\n\\n \\nIn 2008 and 2009, Applicant worked overseas, and a portion of his income was \\nexempt from taxation. In those years, his income was greater than the exemption, and \\nhe incurred taxes that he could not pay. In his security clearance application (SCA), he \\ndisclosed that he owed approximately $36,000 to the IRS for 2008 and 2009 (SOR ¶ \\n1.b). In 2010, his state also filed a $7,213 tax lien against him (SOR ¶ 1.a).7 \\n\\n \\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the state tax lien had been repaid \\nthrough monthly payroll deductions. He also stated that he had a repayment plan with \\nthe IRS and the payments are automatically deducted from his pay.8  \\n\\n  \\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the state tax lien was repaid, but he had \\nnot  yet  received  a  document  from  the  state  showing  it  was  paid.  He  stated  that  the \\ndeductions from his pay for the state tax lien stopped over a year ago. At the hearing, \\nhe also provided IRS account transcripts for 2008 and 2009 that showed he had been \\nconsistently  making  monthly  payments  of  $375  since  August  2012.  As  of  September \\n2015,  his  IRS  account  balance  for  2008  was  $3,961  and  for  2009  was  $17,124.  The \\naccount transcripts showed that his IRS debt had been cut almost in half.9 \\n\\n  \\nBesides the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s credit report dated March 26, \\n2015, reflected that he had no other delinquent debts. He also testified that he had no \\nother delinquent debts. In 2014, he earned about $108,000 and his wife earned about \\n$25,000. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant presented letters from the state that \\nreflected he did not have an outstanding tax liability for 2008 and 2009.10 \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n5 Tr. 26-29; GE 1. \\n \\n6 Tr. 29-32; GE 1-3; AE C. \\n \\n7 Tr. 32-36; GE 1.    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n8 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n9 Tr. 32-36, 46-51; AE D-F. \\n\\n10 Tr. 39-42; AE A, B, H, I; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Policies \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  President  of  the  United  States  has  the  authority  to  control  access  to \\ninformation  bearing  on  national  security  and  to  determine  whether  an  individual  is \\nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \\nEgan,  484  U.S.  518,  527  (1988).  The  President  has  authorized  the  Secretary  of \\nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified  Information  within  Industry  §  2  (Feb.  20,  1960),  as  amended.  The  U.S. \\nSupreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the  Executive  Branch  in \\nregulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security,  emphasizing  that  “no \\none  has  a  ‘right’  to  a  security  clearance.”  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S. \\n518, 528 (1988). \\n\\n \\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  AGs  are  not  inflexible  rules  of \\nlaw.  Instead,  recognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are \\napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An  administrative \\njudge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and \\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  \\n\\n \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \\n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \\nif they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n\\n \\nThe security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\ninformation.

AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply in \\nthis case. \\n \\n \\napplicable:  \\n \\n\\nFour financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially \\n\\n(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred \\nunder  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast \\ndoubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good \\njudgment; \\n \\n(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely \\nbeyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business \\ndownturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or \\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control; and \\n \\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts.  \\n \\nApplicant  incurred  delinquent  debts  because  he  continued  to  receive  disability \\nbenefits  after  his  income  exceeded  earning  limitations  and  because  he  failed  to  pay \\ntaxes  on  income  earned  in  2008  and  2009.  These  events  do  not  constitute \\ncircumstances beyond his control. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  has  resolved  the  state  tax  lien  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  the  disability \\noverpayment  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  has  established  a  repayment  plan  to  resolve  the \\ndelinquent  federal  taxes  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  has  been  consistently  making  payments \\nunder  that  plan  for  the  past  three  years.  The  record  established  that  his  financial \\nproblems  are  under  control  and  are  being  resolved.  He  has  not  incurred  any  recent \\ndelinquent debts. His financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on \\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  I  was \\nassigned the case on December 1, 2015. Based on a thorough review of the case file, I \\nfind that Applicant failed to carry his burden in mitigating security concerns arising under \\nboth Guideline B and Guideline E.  \\n\\n     Findings of Fact \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  71-year-old  man  who  is  presently  not  working  while  his  security \\nclearance is updated. He has earned a high school diploma. He was divorced in 1998 \\n                                                           \\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \\nSecurity  Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative \\nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n1 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\f",
       "and is now estranged from a subsequent spouse. Facts about this estranged female are \\nunclear,  although  it  appears  she  is  from  Russia,  where  she  currently  resides  with  or \\nnear  family.  He  provided  incomplete  information  on  his  security  clearance  application \\n(SCA)  about  his  family  and  children.  Other  discrepancies  appear  throughout  his \\ninvestigatory record. Applicant presently lives in another country with a female foreign \\nnational  in  order  to  reduce  the  costs  he  would  otherwise  expend  living  in  the  United \\nStates while awaiting a return to work.  \\n \\n \\nAt issue in the SOR are the following facts: Applicant has a wife who is a citizen \\nand resident of Russia.2 They are estranged, but Applicant has no plans to divorce his \\nforeign  wife  because  he  no  longer  believes  in  divorce.  He  has  a  daughter  who  is  a \\ncitizen  of  the  United  States  and  is  currently  a  resident  of  Russia,  where  she  is  a \\nuniversity student. He also has parents-in-law who are citizens and residents of Russia. \\nApplicant met them in about July 1998 on a visit to their home. He again saw them on a \\nsubsequent  trip  to  Russia  with  his  wife.  He  has  had  no  other  contact  with  them  and \\ndoes not know how often his estranged wife currently has with her parents now that all \\nthree  are  in  Russia.  His  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  a  teacher  and  a \\ngynecologist,  respectively.  Applicant  assumed  they  were  Communists  because  the \\nCommunists were in power when he met them. As of 2015, Russia is one of the two \\nleading state intelligence threats to United States interests, based on their capabilities, \\nintent,  and  broad  operational  scopes.3  Applicant  admits  the  Guideline  B  SOR \\nallegations, but did not address them in any manner in his SOR Response.     \\n \\n \\nIn completing SCAs in both August 3, 2009, and March 23, 2013, Applicant failed \\nto  list  multiple  names  he  has  used,  places  of  former  residence,  periods  of \\nunemployment, relatives, and foreign contacts. He told an investigator in 2010 that he \\nhad no problems while working with a particular employer, but later conceded he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit while working there. Despite a 2010 claim to the contrary, \\nhe failed in 2007 to file an appropriate contact with foreign nationals report regarding the \\nforeign woman with whom he currently cohabitates. Applicant admits these allegations.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\n                                                           \\n2  In  some  records  within  the  FORM,  Applicant  indicated  that  his  estranged  wife  became  a  naturalized \\ncitizen in 2007 or 2008 and now resides in the United States, but the discrepancies are never resolved. \\n(See FORM, Item 6) \\n \\n3 FORM, Item 9, at 3. \\n\\n2 \\n\\n\f",
       "factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall \\nbe “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b).  \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the Guideline B is set out in AG ¶ 6: \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nlimited \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\f",
       "Applicant remains married to the female of Russian origin at issue. Therefore, it \\ncan be assumed he maintains some level of affection for this woman, the mother of his \\nchild. It can also be assumed he maintains a bond or ties of affection for their child, who \\nis  now  studying  at  a  Russian  college.  As  for  his  in-laws,  while  their  contact  with \\nApplicant is negligible, it can be assumed his estranged partner has ties of affection with \\nher own parents. Those ties are routinely attributed to the spouse (Applicant) in these \\ncases. Given these facts, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 7(a) and (b) apply:  \\n \\n\\nto  protect  sensitive \\n\\nAG ¶ 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\nAG ¶ 7(b) connection to a foreign person, group, government, or country \\nthat  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual’s \\nobligation \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information. \\n \\nIn  finding  disqualifying  conditions  applicable,  I  specifically  note  that  AG  ¶  7(a) \\nrequires substantial evidence of a heightened risk. The heightened risk required to raise \\na  disqualifying  condition  is  a  relatively  low  standard.  Heightened  risk  denotes  a  risk \\ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \\ngovernment or substantial assets in a foreign nation. Russia is one of the two leading \\nstate intelligence threats to United States interests. In addition, foreign family ties can \\npose a security risk even without a connection to a foreign government. This is because \\nan applicant may be subject to coercion or undue influence when a third party pressures \\nor  threatens  an  applicant’s family  members.  Under  these facts,  while  unlikely,  a  third \\nparty  coercion  concern  potentially  exists  in  Russia.  Therefore,  there  is  sufficient \\nevidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\n  \\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8, and find the following are relevant: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \\nwhich  these  persons  are  located,  or  the  positions  or  activities  of  those \\npersons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be \\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \\nand \\n\\n \\n\\nAG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s \\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \\ncountry  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding \\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to \\nresolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\f",
       "The mere possession of close family ties to persons in a foreign country is not, \\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \\na foreign country and an applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \\nthis  factor  alone  is  sufficient  to  create  the  potential  for  foreign  influence  and  could \\npotentially result in the compromise of classified information.  \\n\\n \\nHere,  Applicant  provided  scant  information about  his estranged  wife,  daughter, \\nand  in-laws.  Indeed,  information  about  his  in-laws  is  more  abundant  than  information \\nabout his child and her mother. While his personal ties to his in-laws may be weak, their \\nimpact on Applicant cannot be discerned without more information about his wife and \\nchild. Under these limited facts, no mitigating conditions weigh in Applicant’s favor. \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  personal  conduct  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  15,  where  the \\nsignificance of conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  is  defined  ([p]ersonal  conduct  can \\nraise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information).  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure to  provide  truthful and  candid \\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \\nsecurity clearance process.  \\n\\n \\nIn completing his 2009 and 2013 SCAs, Applicant’s answers in many areas were \\neither deficient or in conflict. His answers in a 2010 interview were either intentionally or \\nnegligently incomplete  with regard to past  workplace problems and the reporting of a \\nforeign  cohabitant  to  his  former  employer.  If  these  inaccuracies  were  intentionally \\nincorrect, such facts could give rise to:  \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  16(a)  deliberate  omission,  concealment,  or  falsification  of  relevant \\nfacts \\nfrom  any  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history \\nstatement,  or  similar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine \\nemployment  qualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security \\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \\nand  \\n \\nAG  ¶  16(b)  deliberately  providing \\ninformation \\nconcerning  relevant  facts  to  an  employer,  investigator,  security  official, \\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative. \\n \\nApplicant admitted all three allegations raised under Guideline E and provided no \\nexplanations or commentary. While his admission to the SCA discrepancies could be \\ndiscounted and his discrepancies found to be the product of negligence, this guideline \\ncould  be  found  in  his  favor.  In  admitting  allegations  that  he  knowingly  withheld \\ninformation and denied having had problems while employed at a place where he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit, however, the facts tend to indicate that these answers – \\nwithout  more  –  were  intentionally  false  or  misleading.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the \\n5 \\n\\nfalse  or  misleading \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\f",
       "absence  of  some  explanation  claiming  forgetfulness  or  another  basis  for  having \\nprovided a negligently entered SCA answer. Therefore, given his admissions, none of \\nthe mitigating conditions at AG ¶ 17(a) – (g) apply.  \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) \\nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \\n \\n \\nApplicant failed to do more than admit the allegations raised in the SOR. He then \\nrequested a judgment based on the written record. It is that very record that is full of \\ndiscrepancies  and  contradictions  that  contributed  to  the  security  concerns  at  issue. \\nThere  are  simply  insufficient  facts  to  evaluate  Applicant’s  foreign  kin,  the  SCA  and \\ninterview inaccuracies, or even the Applicant as an individual. This is simply the result of \\na  deficiently  supplemented  record.

       "On  July  26,  2014,  Applicant  answered  the  SOR,  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations, \\nwaived  his  right  to  a  hearing,  and  elected  to  have  his  case  decided  on  the  written \\nrecord.2  \\n \\n \\nOn  July  22,  2015,  Department  Counsel  prepared  a  file  of  relevant  material \\n(FORM) and sent it to Applicant. The FORM contains the SOR, Applicant’s answer, and \\nresponses to two interrogatories, which were admitted into the record as Exhibits 1 – 4. \\nDepartment Counsel also submitted with the FORM a request for administrative notice, \\nExhibit (Ex.) 5, which is discussed below.  \\n \\n \\nprovided 30 days from its receipt to file a response, but did not submit one. \\n \\n \\nOn December 1, 2015, I was assigned Applicant’s case and provided a copy of \\nthe  FORM.  On  my  own  motion,  I  opened  the  record  to  provide  him  a  last  chance \\nopportunity  to  submit  a  response  to  the  FORM.  He  was  also  advised  of  the  serious \\nsecurity concerns raised by his possession of a current foreign passport and that such \\nconcerns may be mitigated by surrendering or relinquishing the passport as set forth in \\nthe Directive.4 Applicant did not submit a response or provide additional documentation. \\nThe record closed on December 15, 2015. \\n \\n\\nOn  August  31,  2015,  Applicant  acknowledged  receipt  of  the  FORM.3  He  was \\n\\nAdministrative Notice: The Russian Federation (Russia) \\n\\nDOHA  administrative \\n\\njudges  may  accept \\n\\n \\n \\nfor  administrative  notice \\nuncontroverted,  easily  verifiable  facts  regarding  a  foreign  country  from  official  U.S. \\nGovernment reports. Additionally, the official position of relevant federal agencies or the \\npertinent statements of key U.S. Government officials regarding a foreign country may \\nbe appropriate for administrative notice. The party requesting administrative notice of a \\nparticular matter must provide the source document, either the pertinent parts or the full \\ndocument,  to  allow  the  judge  and,  if  necessary,  the  Appeal  Board  to  assess  the \\nreliability, accuracy, and relevancy of any administratively noticed fact.

He received a commission \\nas an officer in Russia’s reserve military forces and worked for a time for the Russian \\nDefense Ministry. He immigrated to the United States in 1997 and married his wife, who \\nis also originally from Russia, in 2002. They have one child, who was born in the United \\nStates.  \\n \\n\\nApplicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2005.  Applicant,  his  wife,  and  his  child  all \\nhave  dual  U.S.-Russian  citizenships.  Since  becoming  a  U.S.  citizen,  Applicant  has \\n                                                           \\n5  Department  Counsel’s  “failure”  to  submit  the  source  documents  is  understandable  as  the  FORM \\npredates  the  cited  Appeal  Board  decision.  Arguably,  Ex.  5  could  be  admitted  as  a  summary  of  the \\npertinent  facts  contained  in  the  source  documents.

However, based on the present record, I cannot find that Applicant’s failure to raise an objection to \\nEx. 5 amounts to an agreement as to the exhibits accuracy, reliability, and relevancy. Contrast with, ISCR \\nCase No. 14-03112 (App. Bd.

Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  an  administrative  judge  applies  the  guidelines  in  a  \\ncommonsense manner, considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a \\nfair and impartial decision.  \\n\\n \\nDepartment  Counsel  must  present  evidence  to  establish  controverted  facts \\nalleged  in  the  SOR.

       "“security  clearance  determinations  should  err,  if  they  must,  on  the  side  of  denials.” \\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \\ntrust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it  grants  access  to  classified  information. \\nDecisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the  possible  risk  an  applicant  may \\ndeliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions \\nentail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than \\nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \\n \\n\\nClearance  decisions  must  be  made  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall \\nin  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the  applicant  concerned.”  E.O. \\n10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance amounts to a finding that an \\napplicant,  at  the  time  the  decision  was  rendered,  did  not  meet  the  strict  guidelines \\nestablished for determining eligibility for access to classified information. \\n\\n \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference  \\n \\n \\nUnder  AG  ¶  9,  the  foreign  preference  security  concern  arises  “[w]hen  an \\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \\nUnited States.” Applicant actively exercised his foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. \\ncitizen,  including  voting  in  Russian  elections  and  renewing,  using,  and  maintaining  a \\nRussian passport. This record evidence raises the foreign preference security concern \\nand  establishes  the  disqualifying  condition  at  AG  ¶  10(a).10  The  foreign  preference \\nguideline also sets forth a number of potential mitigation conditions. I have considered \\nall the mitigating conditions and none apply. Notably, Applicant currently has a foreign \\npassport and is unwilling to relinquish or surrender it. A current or prospective clearance \\nholder  is  ineligible  for  a  security  clearance  unless  s/he  surrenders  it  to  the  cognizant \\nsecurity authority (CSA), invalidates the foreign passport, or receives approval from the \\nCSA for his/her continued possession and use of the foreign passport. See AG ¶¶ 11(d) \\nand  11(e).  Applicant  did  not  supply  any  information  that  any  of  the  preceding \\ncircumstances apply. Accordingly, foreign preference security concerns remain.  \\n \\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\nThe foreign influence security concern is explained at AG ¶ 6:  \\n \\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\n\\n                                                           \\n10 Exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . .

AG ¶ 2(b). \\n \\n \\nI  have  considered  all  the foreign  influence mitigating  conditions and,  based  on \\nthe  record  evidence,  none  apply.  Even  if  I  assume  for  the  sake  of  argument  that \\nApplicant’s property and non-familial connections in Russia are not significant enough to \\ncause  a  conflict  of  interest  with  his  security  obligations,  his  and  his  wife’s  close \\nrelationship to their family members in Russia raise a concern about his vulnerability or \\nsusceptibility to adverse foreign influence. Applicant’s relatives in Russia are subject to \\nthe dictates of a government whose respect for human rights and the rule of law is, at \\nbest, questionable.  Moreover, Russia has been identified by the U.S. Government as \\ncontinuing  to  pose  an  intelligence  threat.  Applicant’s  familial  connections  in  Russia, \\ncoupled with the threat posed by the current Russian government to its own people and \\nthe security threat it poses to the United States, raises a heightened risk that Applicant \\ncould  be  subjected  to  adverse  foreign  influence.  Applicant  did  not  present  sufficient \\ninformation  to  mitigate  this  security  concern.  However,  this  adverse  finding  is  “not  a \\ncomment on Applicant’s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act \\nin unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, \\nsuch as a family member.” ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd.

       "The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\\nAugust 19, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\\ndecision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\\non the written record.  On June 27, 2016, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant’s request for a\\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\\n\\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in making findings\\nof fact and whether the Judge’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\\nwith the following, we affirm.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Findings of Fact  \\n\\nApplicant is 46 years old, married, and has four children.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in\\n1994.    Since  2010,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.    In  his  security  clearance\\napplication, he explained that he encountered difficultly paying bills in 2008 after being laid off\\nfrom a second job due to the company’s bankruptcy.  He gave no explanation for why he did not\\nbegin attempting to resolve the debts until the issuance of the SOR.\\n\\nApplicant admitted each of the five delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.  For the debt in\\nSOR  ¶  1.a  for  about  $500,  Applicant  wrote  in  his  Response  to  Department  Counsel’s  File  of\\nRelevant Material (FORM) that the debt was paid off.  The creditor agreed to accept three monthly\\npayments of about $100 to settle the debt.  A document showed the creditor made arrangements with\\nApplicant to debit electronically about $100 from his account in September 2015 for this debt.  For\\nthe 2009 judgment in SOR ¶ 1.b for about $14,000, Applicant indicated that, at the time he answered\\nthe SOR, he was unable to negotiate a settlement.  In his Response to the FORM, he provided\\ndocuments showing his wages were being garnished biweekly for the next six months for this debt\\nand about $350 was garnished from his pay at the end of November 2015.  No evidence was\\npresented to establish the total amount deducted from his pay or how much is still owed on that debt. \\nFor the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.b, and 1.c for about $2,500, $5,600, and $3600, Applicant wrote in\\nhis Response to the FORM that he is currently on a schedule to repay between $150 and $190 a\\nmonth on each debt until it is resolved.  He provided proof of payments toward those debts from\\nSeptember through November 2015.\\n\\nThe Judge’s Analysis\\n\\nThe  Judge  found  Applicant  did  not  act  responsibly  because,  even  though  he  has  been\\nemployed by his current employer since 2010, he only began making payments towards the debts\\nafter the SOR was issued.  The Judge also concluded that, while the mitigation condition concerning\\nthe initiation of a good-faith effort to repay the creditors was applicable, it was not controlling\\nbecause Applicant must establish a consistent history of continuing to resolve his debts. \\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n2\\n\\n\n",
       "In the appeal brief, Applicant provided character reference letters and documents showing\\npayments  on,  or  settlement  of,  various  debts.    Most  of  those  documents,  however,  were  not\\npreviously submitted to the Judge and constitute new evidence that the Appeal Board is prohibited\\nfrom receiving or considering.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  \\n\\nApplicant claims the Judge erred in the findings of fact.  For example, he states that he has\\nsix children (instead of four) and started working for his current employer in 2012 (instead of 2010). \\nIn  his  security  clearance  application,  however,  Applicant  listed  that  he  had  four  children  and\\nindicated he started working for his employer in 2010.  He failed to establish that the Judge erred\\nin the findings of fact.  Our review reveals the Judge’s material findings are based upon substantial\\nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the record\\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. July 25, 2014).  Applicant also argues\\nthat he mitigated the security concerns arising from his debts.  His arguments are not sufficient to\\nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\\nlaw.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06634 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 28, 2016).   \\n   \\n\\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\\ndecision.

Eligibility  for \\n\\naccess to classified information is granted.  \\n \\n\\nStatement of the Case \\n\\nOn October 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \\nReasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under  Guideline  F,  financial \\nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \\n1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  implemented  by \\nthe DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  responded  to  the  SOR  on  November  14,  2014,  and  requested  a \\nhearing  before  an  administrative  judge.  The  case  was  originally  assigned  to  me  on \\nFebruary 27, 2015. Scheduling of the case was delayed because Applicant was working \\noverseas. The case was reassigned to me on May 4, 2015. After coordinating with the \\nparties, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1 \\n\\n\n",
       "on  July  16,  2015,  scheduling  the  hearing  for  August  18,  2015.  The  hearing  was \\nconvened  as  scheduled.  DOHA  received  the  hearing  transcript  (Tr.)  on  August  26, \\n2015.  \\n \\n\\nEvidentiary Rulings \\n\\nGovernment  Exhibits  (GE)  1,  2,  4,  5,  and  6  were  admitted  in  evidence  without \\nobjection. GE 3 was admitted over Applicant’s objection. Applicant testified, called five \\nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through Z, which were admitted \\nwithout  objection.  The  record  was  held  open  for  Applicant  to  submit  additional \\ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked AE AA and BB1 and admitted \\nwithout objection.  \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 57-year-old self-employed contractor for a defense contractor. He \\nserved  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1979  until  he  retired  in  2000.  He  seeks  to  retain  a \\nsecurity clearance, which he has held since he was in the military. He attended college \\nfor a period, but he is a few credits shy of a degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. \\nHe has been married to his current spouse for more than 25 years. He has two adult \\nchildren.2 \\n \\n \\nApplicant spent the majority of his military career in special operations. He went \\non  numerous  combat  missions,  conducted  clandestine  insertions,  and  operated \\nundercover.  When  he  retired  he  became  an  entrepreneur  and  started  his  own \\ncompanies.  His  primary  company  was  incorporated,  but  Applicant  had  to  personally \\nguarantee many of the company’s liabilities. He also invested in real estate. His primary \\ncompany  suffered  significant  setbacks  during  the  recession  and  housing  crisis  of  the \\nlater part of the 2000s. His real estate properties lost much of their value. He closed his \\nprimary  company  in  2009  and  has  been  working  since  then  as  a  self-employed \\ncontractor and subcontractor for other companies. He has spent much of the last five \\nyears working overseas in dangerous assignments.3 \\n \\n  \\nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, which include a $58,161 judgment (SOR \\n¶  1.a),  mortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶  1.c  -  $30,994;  SOR  ¶  1.d  -  $351,562;  SOR  ¶  1.e  - \\n$271,900; and SOR ¶ 1.f - $50,688), two business-related debts (SOR ¶ 1.b - $18,028 \\nand SOR ¶ 1.h - $77,115) and federal taxes (SOR ¶ 1.g - $33,882 for tax year 2008, \\nand SOR ¶ 1.i – no amount alleged for tax years 2012 and 2013). Applicant admitted \\nowing most of the debts at some point, but several of the debts were paid, settled, or \\notherwise resolved. \\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n1  Counsel  marked  the  post-hearing  submissions  as  Z  and  AA,  but  AE  Z  was  already  admitted  at  the \\nhearing.  \\n \\n2 Tr. at 118, 123-127, 184; GE 1, 3 AE A. \\n \\n3 Tr. at 28-31, 120, 127-131; GE 1, 3; AE A, T. \\n\\n \\n2 \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nApplicant’s primary company was growing, and it leased a larger warehouse in \\nabout  2008.  The  business  ultimately  failed,  and  the  company  broke  the  lease.  The \\nowner of the warehouse sued  Applicant  personally  and  obtained a $58,161 judgment \\nagainst  him  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  on  this \\njudgment.4  \\n \\n \\nApplicant and a partner had a falling out over the business. The ex-partner sued \\nApplicant  for  $160,000.  They  reached  a  settlement  through  arbitration  in  which \\nApplicant agreed to pay the ex-partner $163,000 by 2010. He paid about $86,000, but \\nhe  was  unable  to  pay  the  remainder  when  the  company  closed.  The  partner  either \\nobtained  a  judgment  for  $77,000  or  sought  to  enforce  the  arbitrated  settlement. \\nApplicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  for  the  remainder  owed  to  the  ex-\\npartner.5 \\n \\nIn February 2013, Applicant settled the $20,302 business credit card debt alleged \\n \\nin  SOR  ¶  1.b  (alleged  as  $18,028  in  SOR)  for  $10,151,  which  was  paid  in  February \\n2013. Applicant submitted proof in his response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2014 \\nthat the debt had been settled.

The IRS filed a $33,882 tax lien against Applicant in June 2010 \\n(SOR ¶ 1.g). In January 2011, the IRS applied his $15,892 refund from his 2007 taxes \\nto his 2008 taxes. Applicant paid the remaining $5,689 owed for 2008 in January 2013. \\nThe  2014  credit  reports  obtained  by  the  Government  report  the  lien  as  released  in \\nJanuary 2013.7 \\n \\n \\nApplicant owed the IRS $65,863 for his 2012 and 2013 federal income taxes. In \\nApril  2015,  he  submitted  a  proposed  installment  agreement  to  the  IRS  whereby  he \\nwould  pay  an  initial  $915  and  then  $500  per  month  until  paid.  In  July  2015,  the  IRS \\naccepted  Applicant’s  installment  agreement  and  added  his  2014  taxes.  On  June  5, \\n2015,  Applicant  paid  the  IRS  $56,415  for  his  2014  taxes.  On  July  9,  2015,  he  paid \\n$10,000 toward his estimated taxes for 2015.8 \\n \\n \\nApplicant used to own five properties consisting of his residence and four rental \\nproperties. Some of his tenants did not pay their rent, and he also had a property vacant \\nfor an extended period. Applicant bought his home and another property when he was \\nin the military. He still has those properties, plus another, but he lost two properties to \\nforeclosure.

He credibly testified that it will \\ntake time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts.14  \\n \\n \\nApplicant’s character evidence was extraordinary. He submitted numerous letters \\nand  several  witnesses  testified.  Many  of  the  authors  and  witnesses  served  with \\nApplicant in special operations. His former commanding officer testified that he served \\nwith  Applicant  under  conditions  that  the  commanding  officer  modesty  described  as \\n“quite  stressful.”  The  endorsements  of  the  witnessses  and  authors  were  unequivocal \\nand exceptional.15 \\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in \\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s \\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \\nto  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables \\nknown  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all \\navailable,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and \\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \\nor  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The \\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\n \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\n                                                           \\n14 Tr. at 50, 180-181, 190-193, 197; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3 ; AE A, U, W, Y. \\n \\n15 Tr. at 25-28, 50-51, 62-74; AE B-L, T. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n\\n\n",

       "(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control; and \\n\\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts. \\n\\n \\nApplicant owed and still owes a lot of money, but the SOR overstated his debts. \\n  \\nThe evidence available to the Government (credit reports and documents submitted by \\nApplicant in response to interrogatories) established that before the SOR was issued, \\nApplicant  settled  the  $18,028  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b,  and  he  paid  the  IRS  the \\n$33,882 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. Additionally, the SOR alleged the high credit on the two \\nmortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  -  $351,562  and  1.e  -  $271,900),  when  the  balances  on \\nthose loans were reported as zero.  \\n \\n  \\nApplicant paid his 2008 federal income taxes. He has a payment plan in place for \\nhis  2012  and  2013  tax  years.  He  settled  and  paid  the  second  mortgage  loan  on  his \\nhome,  and  he  paid  other  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  His  attorney  is \\nnegotiating  settlements  for  the  two  judgments  against  him.  Applicant  credibly  testified \\nthat it will take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts. \\n \\n \\nI find that Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he \\ntook significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly and made a good-\\nfaith effort to pay his debts. There are clear indications that his financial problems are \\nbeing  resolved  and  are  under  control.  They  occurred  under  circumstances  that  are \\nunlikely  to  recur  and  do  not  cast  doubt  on  his  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and \\ngood judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. \\nAG ¶ 20(a) is not yet completely applicable because Applicant is still in the process of \\npaying his debts.  \\n \\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\n \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nthe  conduct, \\n\\nthe  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of \\nto \\n\\nthe  conduct;  (2) \\nthe \\n(1) \\ncircumstances  surrounding \\ninclude  knowledgeable \\nparticipation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the \\nindividual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \\nwhich  participation \\nthe  presence  or  absence  of \\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \\nfor  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or \\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \\n\\nis  voluntary;  (6) \\n\\n \\n7 \\n\\n\n",
       " \\nUnder AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \\nsecurity  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful \\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \\n \\n\\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions  in  light  of  all \\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \\nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \\n\\n \\nApplicant’s  character  evidence  was  extraordinary.  His  financial  problems  are \\nlarge, but not insurmountable. Applicant credibly testified that he will eventually resolve \\nall his debts. His sacrifices in service to this country have earned him the time to do so. \\n\\n \\nOverall,  the  record  evidence  leaves  me  without  questions  or  doubts  as  to \\nApplicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.

Applicant had no objection to the motion. The motion was granted, and those \\nallegations were withdrawn.1 \\n \\n \\nDepartment Counsel made a motion to amend SOR ¶ 1.a to reflect that the debt \\nwas owed to a state instead of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Applicant had no \\nobjection to the amendment. The motion to amend was granted.2 \\n \\n\\nFindings of Fact \\n\\n \\n \\nApplicant is a 40-year-old mechanic who works as a quality assurance inspector \\nfor  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been  working  for  that  contractor  in  the  Middle  East \\nsince May 2011 and has worked overseas for other defense contractors for a number of \\nyears.  He  earned  a  general  educational  development  certificate  in  1996  and  an \\nassociate’s degree in 2003. He has been married twice. He married his current wife in \\n2005. He has three children, ages 15, 16, and 22.3 \\n \\n\\nExcluding  the  withdrawn  allegations,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  three \\ndelinquent  debts  totaling  $64,168  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c).  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he \\ndenied each debt. Substantial evidence of the alleged debts is contained in GE 1-4.4  \\n\\n \\nIn 1999, Applicant was involved in a car accident and incurred a broken pelvis \\nand hip. He was determined to be fully disabled and collected about $1,000 per month \\nin disability payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA). While receiving the \\ndisability benefits, he knew there was a limit on how much income he could earn, but \\ndid not know the exact restrictions. In 2006, he received a letter from SSA that indicated \\n                                                           \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1 Tr. 23-25.  \\n\\n2 Tr. 43-44.  \\n\\n3 Tr. 5-7, 23, 37-39, 42-43; GE 1. \\n\\n4 GE 1-4; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.  \\n\\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "he was earning more income than he was allowed. At that time, his disability payments \\nstopped, and he has not received any further disability payments since then.5 \\n\\n \\nA credit report dated June 12, 2010, reflected that Applicant’s SSA account had \\nbeen  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $20,955  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  This  delinquent \\naccount was the result of his overpayment of disability payments. In 2008, he started \\nrepaying this debt through a monthly pay allotment of $300. When he left his job later \\nthat year, the allotment stopped. In 2012, the SSA began garnishing his pay at a rate of \\n$600 every two weeks. By early 2014 (well before the issuance of the SOR), he fully \\nrepaid this debt. In July 2014, he received a letter from the SSA stating he overpaid the \\ndebt and would be receiving a refund of $2,535.6 \\n\\n \\nIn 2008 and 2009, Applicant worked overseas, and a portion of his income was \\nexempt from taxation. In those years, his income was greater than the exemption, and \\nhe incurred taxes that he could not pay. In his security clearance application (SCA), he \\ndisclosed that he owed approximately $36,000 to the IRS for 2008 and 2009 (SOR ¶ \\n1.b). In 2010, his state also filed a $7,213 tax lien against him (SOR ¶ 1.a).7 \\n\\n \\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the state tax lien had been repaid \\nthrough monthly payroll deductions. He also stated that he had a repayment plan with \\nthe IRS and the payments are automatically deducted from his pay.8  \\n\\n  \\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the state tax lien was repaid, but he had \\nnot  yet  received  a  document  from  the  state  showing  it  was  paid.  He  stated  that  the \\ndeductions from his pay for the state tax lien stopped over a year ago. At the hearing, \\nhe also provided IRS account transcripts for 2008 and 2009 that showed he had been \\nconsistently  making  monthly  payments  of  $375  since  August  2012.  As  of  September \\n2015,  his  IRS  account  balance  for  2008  was  $3,961  and  for  2009  was  $17,124.  The \\naccount transcripts showed that his IRS debt had been cut almost in half.9 \\n\\n  \\nBesides the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s credit report dated March 26, \\n2015, reflected that he had no other delinquent debts. He also testified that he had no \\nother delinquent debts. In 2014, he earned about $108,000 and his wife earned about \\n$25,000. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant presented letters from the state that \\nreflected he did not have an outstanding tax liability for 2008 and 2009.10 \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n5 Tr. 26-29; GE 1. \\n \\n6 Tr. 29-32; GE 1-3; AE C. \\n \\n7 Tr. 32-36; GE 1.    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n8 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n9 Tr. 32-36, 46-51; AE D-F. \\n\\n10 Tr. 39-42; AE A, B, H, I; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Policies \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  President  of  the  United  States  has  the  authority  to  control  access  to \\ninformation  bearing  on  national  security  and  to  determine  whether  an  individual  is \\nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \\nEgan,  484  U.S.  518,  527  (1988).  The  President  has  authorized  the  Secretary  of \\nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \\nClassified  Information  within  Industry  §  2  (Feb.  20,  1960),  as  amended.  The  U.S. \\nSupreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the  Executive  Branch  in \\nregulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security,  emphasizing  that  “no \\none  has  a  ‘right’  to  a  security  clearance.”  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S. \\n518, 528 (1988). \\n\\n \\nEligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the \\ncriteria  contained  in  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  AGs  are  not  inflexible  rules  of \\nlaw.  Instead,  recognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are \\napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An  administrative \\njudge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and \\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  \\n\\n \\nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \\naccess  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and \\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \\npossible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible \\nextrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified \\ninformation. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in \\nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. \\nOr.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a \\nclearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the \\nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \\na clearance. \\n\\n \\nInitially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in \\nthe  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant \\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \\nof  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  \\n“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. \\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \\npresume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the \\ncriteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \\n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial \\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \\nfacts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \\nclearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of \\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \\nif they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \\n\\n \\nThe security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\nFailure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet \\nfinancial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or \\nunwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise \\nquestions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to \\nprotect  classified \\nfinancially \\noverextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate \\nfunds.  \\n \\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \\n\\ninformation.

       "(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem \\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \\nunder control; and \\n \\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \\notherwise resolve debts.  \\n \\nApplicant  incurred  delinquent  debts  because  he  continued  to  receive  disability \\nbenefits  after  his  income  exceeded  earning  limitations  and  because  he  failed  to  pay \\ntaxes  on  income  earned  in  2008  and  2009.  These  events  do  not  constitute \\ncircumstances beyond his control. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. \\n\\n \\nApplicant  has  resolved  the  state  tax  lien  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  the  disability \\noverpayment  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  has  established  a  repayment  plan  to  resolve  the \\ndelinquent  federal  taxes  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  has  been  consistently  making  payments \\nunder  that  plan  for  the  past  three  years.  The  record  established  that  his  financial \\nproblems  are  under  control  and  are  being  resolved.  He  has  not  incurred  any  recent \\ndelinquent debts. His financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on \\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) \\napply. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n\\nIn  the  adjudication  process,  an  administrative  judge  must  carefully  weigh  a \\nnumber  of  variables  known  as  the  whole-person  concept.  Available  information  about \\nthe applicant as well as the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a) should be considered in reaching \\na  determination.11  In  this  case,  I  gave  due  consideration  to  the  information  about \\nApplicant in the record and concluded the favorable information, including the mitigating \\nevidence,  outweigh  the  security  concerns  at  issue.  Applicant  met  his  burden  of \\npersuasion to mitigate the security concerns.  \\n\\nFormal findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive \\n\\nare:          \\n\\nFormal Findings \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n11 The adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows:  \\n\\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \\nconduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the \\nconduct;  (4)  the  individual’s  age  and  maturity  at  the  time  of  the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent  to \\nwhich  participation  is  voluntary;  (6)  the  presence  or  absence  of  rehabilitation  and  other \\npermanent  behavioral  changes;  (7)  the  motivation  for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for \\npressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or  duress;  and  (9)  the  likelihood  of  continuation  or \\nrecurrence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",

Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  I  was \\nassigned the case on December 1, 2015. Based on a thorough review of the case file, I \\nfind that Applicant failed to carry his burden in mitigating security concerns arising under \\nboth Guideline B and Guideline E.  \\n\\n     Findings of Fact \\n\\n \\nApplicant  is  a  71-year-old  man  who  is  presently  not  working  while  his  security \\nclearance is updated. He has earned a high school diploma. He was divorced in 1998 \\n                                                           \\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \\nSecurity  Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative \\nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. \\n\\n1 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\n",
       "and is now estranged from a subsequent spouse. Facts about this estranged female are \\nunclear,  although  it  appears  she  is  from  Russia,  where  she  currently  resides  with  or \\nnear  family.  He  provided  incomplete  information  on  his  security  clearance  application \\n(SCA)  about  his  family  and  children.  Other  discrepancies  appear  throughout  his \\ninvestigatory record. Applicant presently lives in another country with a female foreign \\nnational  in  order  to  reduce  the  costs  he  would  otherwise  expend  living  in  the  United \\nStates while awaiting a return to work.  \\n \\n \\nAt issue in the SOR are the following facts: Applicant has a wife who is a citizen \\nand resident of Russia.2 They are estranged, but Applicant has no plans to divorce his \\nforeign  wife  because  he  no  longer  believes  in  divorce.  He  has  a  daughter  who  is  a \\ncitizen  of  the  United  States  and  is  currently  a  resident  of  Russia,  where  she  is  a \\nuniversity student. He also has parents-in-law who are citizens and residents of Russia. \\nApplicant met them in about July 1998 on a visit to their home. He again saw them on a \\nsubsequent  trip  to  Russia  with  his  wife.  He  has  had  no  other  contact  with  them  and \\ndoes not know how often his estranged wife currently has with her parents now that all \\nthree  are  in  Russia.  His  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  a  teacher  and  a \\ngynecologist,  respectively.  Applicant  assumed  they  were  Communists  because  the \\nCommunists were in power when he met them. As of 2015, Russia is one of the two \\nleading state intelligence threats to United States interests, based on their capabilities, \\nintent,  and  broad  operational  scopes.3  Applicant  admits  the  Guideline  B  SOR \\nallegations, but did not address them in any manner in his SOR Response.     \\n \\n \\nIn completing SCAs in both August 3, 2009, and March 23, 2013, Applicant failed \\nto  list  multiple  names  he  has  used,  places  of  former  residence,  periods  of \\nunemployment, relatives, and foreign contacts. He told an investigator in 2010 that he \\nhad no problems while working with a particular employer, but later conceded he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit while working there. Despite a 2010 claim to the contrary, \\nhe failed in 2007 to file an appropriate contact with foreign nationals report regarding the \\nforeign woman with whom he currently cohabitates. Applicant admits these allegations.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPolicies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nWhen  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability \\n\\n \\n \\nthe \\nadministrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief \\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \\ndisqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. \\n \\n\\nfor  a  security  clearance, \\n\\nThese  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the \\ncomplexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the \\n                                                           \\n2  In  some  records  within  the  FORM,  Applicant  indicated  that  his  estranged  wife  became  a  naturalized \\ncitizen in 2007 or 2008 and now resides in the United States, but the discrepancies are never resolved. \\n(See FORM, Item 6) \\n \\n3 FORM, Item 9, at 3. \\n\\n2 \\n\\n\n",
       "factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching \\nadjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ \\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \\nthe  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, \\nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \\n\\n \\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) \\nrequires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to \\nclassified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this \\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \\non the evidence contained in the record.  \\n\\n \\nUnder Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \\ncontroverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is \\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \\nmitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel  and  has  the \\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  \\n\\nthe  Government  predicated  upon \\n\\n \\nA  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary \\nrelationship  with \\ntrust  and  confidence.  This \\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \\nGovernment  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it \\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \\nthe  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard \\nclassified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall \\nbe “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b).  \\n\\nThe security concern relating to the Guideline B is set out in AG ¶ 6: \\n\\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \\nany  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should \\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \\nfinancial \\nto,  such \\nconsiderations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United \\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \\nrisk of terrorism. \\n\\nincluding,  but  not \\n\\nlocated, \\n\\ninterest \\n\\nlimited \\n\\nis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\n",
       "Applicant remains married to the female of Russian origin at issue. Therefore, it \\ncan be assumed he maintains some level of affection for this woman, the mother of his \\nchild. It can also be assumed he maintains a bond or ties of affection for their child, who \\nis  now  studying  at  a  Russian  college.  As  for  his  in-laws,  while  their  contact  with \\nApplicant is negligible, it can be assumed his estranged partner has ties of affection with \\nher own parents. Those ties are routinely attributed to the spouse (Applicant) in these \\ncases. Given these facts, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 7(a) and (b) apply:  \\n \\n\\nto  protect  sensitive \\n\\nAG ¶ 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \\nassociate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a \\nforeign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign \\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \\n \\nAG ¶ 7(b) connection to a foreign person, group, government, or country \\nthat  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual’s \\nobligation \\nthe \\nindividual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \\nthat information. \\n \\nIn  finding  disqualifying  conditions  applicable,  I  specifically  note  that  AG  ¶  7(a) \\nrequires substantial evidence of a heightened risk. The heightened risk required to raise \\na  disqualifying  condition  is  a  relatively  low  standard.  Heightened  risk  denotes  a  risk \\ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \\ngovernment or substantial assets in a foreign nation. Russia is one of the two leading \\nstate intelligence threats to United States interests. In addition, foreign family ties can \\npose a security risk even without a connection to a foreign government. This is because \\nan applicant may be subject to coercion or undue influence when a third party pressures \\nor  threatens  an  applicant’s family  members.  Under  these facts,  while  unlikely,  a  third \\nparty  coercion  concern  potentially  exists  in  Russia.  Therefore,  there  is  sufficient \\nevidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \\n\\ninformation  or \\n\\ntechnology  and \\n\\n  \\nAG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \\n\\nof the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8, and find the following are relevant: \\n \\n\\nAG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \\nwhich  these  persons  are  located,  or  the  positions  or  activities  of  those \\npersons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be \\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \\nand \\n\\n \\n\\nAG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s \\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \\ncountry  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding \\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to \\nresolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\n",
       "The mere possession of close family ties to persons in a foreign country is not, \\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \\na foreign country and an applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \\nthis  factor  alone  is  sufficient  to  create  the  potential  for  foreign  influence  and  could \\npotentially result in the compromise of classified information.  \\n\\n \\nHere,  Applicant  provided  scant  information about  his estranged  wife,  daughter, \\nand  in-laws.  Indeed,  information  about  his  in-laws  is  more  abundant  than  information \\nabout his child and her mother. While his personal ties to his in-laws may be weak, their \\nimpact on Applicant cannot be discerned without more information about his wife and \\nchild. Under these limited facts, no mitigating conditions weigh in Applicant’s favor. \\n\\nThe  security  concern  for  personal  conduct  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  15,  where  the \\nsignificance of conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \\nunwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  is  defined  ([p]ersonal  conduct  can \\nraise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect \\nclassified  information).  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure to  provide  truthful and  candid \\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \\nsecurity clearance process.  \\n\\n \\nIn completing his 2009 and 2013 SCAs, Applicant’s answers in many areas were \\neither deficient or in conflict. His answers in a 2010 interview were either intentionally or \\nnegligently incomplete  with regard to past  workplace problems and the reporting of a \\nforeign  cohabitant  to  his  former  employer.  If  these  inaccuracies  were  intentionally \\nincorrect, such facts could give rise to:  \\n\\n \\nAG  ¶  16(a)  deliberate  omission,  concealment,  or  falsification  of  relevant \\nfacts \\nfrom  any  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history \\nstatement,  or  similar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine \\nemployment  qualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security \\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \\nand  \\n \\nAG  ¶  16(b)  deliberately  providing \\ninformation \\nconcerning  relevant  facts  to  an  employer,  investigator,  security  official, \\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative. \\n \\nApplicant admitted all three allegations raised under Guideline E and provided no \\nexplanations or commentary. While his admission to the SCA discrepancies could be \\ndiscounted and his discrepancies found to be the product of negligence, this guideline \\ncould  be  found  in  his  favor.  In  admitting  allegations  that  he  knowingly  withheld \\ninformation and denied having had problems while employed at a place where he was \\ninvolved in a harassment suit, however, the facts tend to indicate that these answers – \\nwithout  more  –  were  intentionally  false  or  misleading.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the \\n5 \\n\\nfalse  or  misleading \\n\\n \\n\\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\n",
       "absence  of  some  explanation  claiming  forgetfulness  or  another  basis  for  having \\nprovided a negligently entered SCA answer. Therefore, given his admissions, none of \\nthe mitigating conditions at AG ¶ 17(a) – (g) apply.  \\n\\nWhole-Person Concept \\n \\n \\nUnder  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an \\napplicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s \\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) \\nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \\n \\n \\nApplicant failed to do more than admit the allegations raised in the SOR. He then \\nrequested a judgment based on the written record. It is that very record that is full of \\ndiscrepancies  and  contradictions  that  contributed  to  the  security  concerns  at  issue. \\nThere  are  simply  insufficient  facts  to  evaluate  Applicant’s  foreign  kin,  the  SCA  and \\ninterview inaccuracies, or even the Applicant as an individual. This is simply the result of \\na  deficiently  supplemented  record.
